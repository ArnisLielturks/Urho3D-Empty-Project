# Urho3D-Empty-Project
A basic app skeleton which uses global notifications and level management with fade-in/fade-out effects. Project uses code samples from the community.

## How to build
Make sure that the URHO3D_HOME environment variable is set and points to the right directory. Build this the same way how you would build Urho3D engine itself

### Ubuntu:
```
git clone https://github.com/ArnisLielturks/Urho3D-Empty-Project.git
cd Urho3D-Empty-Project
./cmake_generic.sh build
cd  build
make
```


If everything worked, build/bin directory should contain `EmptyProject` executable.


And of course here's the quick preview of how it should look in the end:
